# PokemonRandomForestMachineLearning
The purpose of this project was to implement a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest in order to predict a mystery pokemon.  The training process involves having one constant attacking Pokemon against a controlled set of defending Pokemon.  Based on the results of the attack, and calculations involving typing (not effective, normal effective, super effective, etc), we end up with a model that can predict a mystery defending Pokemon from any newly introduced set.
