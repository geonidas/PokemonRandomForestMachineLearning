A balanced team of Pokemon is essential when battling trainers in the world of Pokemon. Having a balanced team of Pokemon ensures that the members of the team can be effective against each others' weaknesses, be a good combination of offense and defense, and have supporting diverse attributes such as stats and moves. The purpose of our project is to create a Machine Learning Model that can create a balanced team of Pokemon.
